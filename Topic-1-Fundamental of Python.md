what a data scientis Do ? 
-whenever we enter in company as a data science that follow a data science life cycle 

Business understanding -> data collection ->data preperations (clean) ->exploratory data analytics (amazon- which product high sell ,which coty..)->modeling (like recommandation model in shopping) -> model evalution (test the our model like we choose tshirt and show shoes so therefore require to acuurate) ->model deployment (choose platform where you deploy your model for increase a growth ,there is no meaning to deploy any platform bcoz its possible to no use that platform any  ) ->business understang

-after deployment many employee test that for accurcy and (testing purpose)

in companies many deparment such as marketing,product,customer operating all that space data science able to work anywhere 

in each and every steps need to python 

| python| -> ML -> DL


*  python is a programming language

prograamming means we write code in our lang and  converted into byte code using translator 

- compiler : translate whole program at a time 
- interpreter : execute program line by line  -use for testing and debug
- debug: tool that help developer to find and fix the issue  and also stop the executiona nd you can show each steps  -it is monitor a  runtime behaviour to identify the error 


*why are we studying python for data science ?

- commonly used to develope chatbots - chat GPT, google assistant, siri ...
- used to build recommandation systems used by e commerece platform like Amazon and streaming service like netflix 
- image recognition and  faciaal recognition ( lock open ) ,Tesla Car 


* libraries
-it is most imp bcoz it time utilize and do just a second work 
 for example calculator : Math, Pandas, Matplot 

tensorflow - opensorce py library - developed by google 
coca cola used that for fuel its mobile proof of purchase model which help the company save million of dollars by eliminating production line printers.

-used in various AI based health care applications,including mediacal imaging analysis,disease diagnosis,drug discovery ad personal medicine
-fraud detection ,risk assessment, credit scoring  ( gmail - when you open on anaother browse rthen notify you that..)
-speech recognition system such as amazon alexa

-pytorch -open souce library - developed by facebook's (Meta) AI research lab.
twitter uses that for natural lang processing task
microsoft use that for research and development in AI 

-py provide wide range of library 
-faster and easy to use


* history about python 
-highlevel, general purpose programming lang -created by guido van rossum and first release in 1991
 now it is a part of team at microsoft working to speed up the lang performace and microsoft blog post report that py 3.11 had speedups of 10 % -60% to some part of lang


in 1991  not in www
in 2000 to 2010 - for website 
in 2011 to 2012 - Android  
now used in AI 

- anaconda navigaor is GUI which is popular python distribution for data science and ML task 
-distribution means work in any type of data 

-provide easy to use interface for managing packages,env , especially in the realm of datascience and scientific computing

py->distribution -> anaconda navigator -> IDE -> jupyter notebook

IDE -> tool where yo u can 
     code (write)
     code (run)
     code (error)
     code (visualization)


9 best py IDE and code editor 
 -pycharm
 -spyder
 -idle
 -vs code
 -sublime text
 -atom
 jupyter
 -visual studio
 -vim

which of the populat IDE ? jupyter  (73%) 

# spotify Curious Data Minds [ master mind -alex bodman]
356M listeners is unique , spotify is using its global `Only You` messaging to show that with over 70M sngs and 2.6 M podcasts to choose from ,your listeingng habits are as disinctive as your fingerprints

-name 
-phone number
- mail id
